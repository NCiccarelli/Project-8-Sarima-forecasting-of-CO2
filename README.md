This repository uses the SARIMA model to forecast CO2. Grid Search is used to select the best SARIMA model. Two different forecasting strategies are used in the repository: (1) we use 10-periods-ahead forecasting, and (2) we iterate a one-period-ahead forecasting strategy. The first strategy proves to be more performant than the latter strategy. 

We do not report all the details about the dataset used in this repository, as the the data that is used in this repository is fully described at the following link: https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/datasets/generated/co2.html
